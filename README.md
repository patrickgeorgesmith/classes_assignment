# Class Exercises

(1 - 8 are the same as on the previous lab, but creating classes using ES6 syntax instead of constructor functions)

## Question 1

a. Write a class called `Person` that has 3 properties: a first name, a last name and a middle name. Create 2 instances of a `Person`. Print one of their first names.
```
class Person {
  constructor(firstName, middleName, lastName) {
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.middleName = middleName;
    this.lastName = lastName 
}
}
let person1 = new Person('Ben', 'Marcus', 'Smith')
let person2 = new Person('Lisa', 'Marie', 'Jimenez')

console.log(person1.firstName)

```

b. Write a method in `Person` called `fullName` that will return a formatted string of an instance's full name. Call this method on both the instances you created in part a.

```
class Person {
  constructor(firstName, middleName, lastName) {
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.middleName = middleName;
    this.lastName = lastName 
}
  fullName() {
    return (`${this.firstName} ${this.middleName} ${this.lastName}`)
  }
}

```
## Question 2

a. Create a class called `Book` that has properties `title`, `author` and `rating`. Create some instances of `Book`.

```
class Book {
  constructor(title, author, rating){
    this.title = title;
    this.author = author;
    this.rating = rating
  }

}

let firstBook = new Book('Flowers for algernon', 'Daniel Keyes,'10)

let secondBook = new Book('The subtle art of not giving a F), 'Mark Manson', 4)

b. Add a method to `Book` called `isGood` that returns `true` if its rating is greater than or equal to 7

class Book {
  constructor(title, author, rating){
    this.title = title;
    this.author = author;
    this.rating = rating
  }
  isGood(){
   return this.rating >= 7 ? true : false
    }
  }

```
## Question 3

a. Create a `Dog` class with four properties: `name (string), breed (string), mood (string), and hungry (boolean)`.
```
class Dog {
  constructor(name,breed, mood, hungry){
    this.name = name;
    this.breed = breed;
    this.mood = mood;
    this.hungry = hungry
    }
  }
}

```
b. Add a method called `playFetch`. It should set the dog's `hungry` property to `true`, set its mood property to `playful`, and log "Ruff!"

```
class Dog {
  constructor(name,breed, mood, hungry){
    this.name = name;
    this.breed = breed;
    this.mood = mood;
    this.hungry = hungry
    }
    playFetch(){
      this.hungry = true
      this.mood = 'playful'
      console.log("Ruff!")
    }
  }

```
c. Add a method called `feed`. If the dog is hungry, it should set `hungry` to `false` and print "Woof!" If the dog is not hungry, it should log "The dog doesn't look hungry"
```
class Dog {
  constructor(name,breed, mood, hungry){
    this.name = name;
    this.breed = breed;
    this.mood = mood;
    this.hungry = hungry
    }
    playFetch(){
      this.hungry = true
      this.mood = 'playful'
      console.log("Ruff!")
    }
    feed (){
      if(this.hungry){
        this.hungry = false
        console.log('Woof!')
      } else {  
          console.log(("The dog does't look hungry"))

      }
    }
  }
```



d. Add a method called `toString` that returns a description of the dog:
```
constructor(name,breed, mood, hungry){
    this.name = name;
    this.breed = breed;
    this.mood = mood;
    this.hungry = hungry
    }
    playFetch(){
      this.hungry = true
      this.mood = 'playful'
      console.log("Ruff!")
    }
    feed (){
      if(this.hungry){
        this.hungry = false
        console.log('Woof!')
      } else {  
          console.log(("The dog does't look hungry"))

      }
      toString(){
        return `${this.name} is a ${this.mood} ${this.breed}.`
      }
    }
  }

```
## Question 4

There are three common scales that are used to measure temperature: Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin:

C = (F - 32) / 1.8
F = 1.8 * C + 32
K = C + 273

a. Make an object called `freezingPoint` that has three properties: `celsius`, `fahrenheit`, and `kelvin`. Give them all values equal to the freezing point of water.
```
let freezingPoint = {
  celsius: 0,
  fahrenheit: 32,
  kelvin: 273.2
}

```
b. Make a class called `Celsius` that has one property: `celsius`, and two methods `getFahrenheitTemp`, and `getKelvinTemp`.


```
class Celsius {
  constructor(celsius){
    this.celsius = celsius
  }
  getFahrenheitTemp(){
    return console.log(`It is ${(this.celsius * 1.8) + 32} degrees in Fahrenheit`)
  }
  getKelvinTemp() {
    return console.log(`It is ${this.celsius + 273.15} degrees in Kevlin`)
  }
  isBelowFreezing (){
    if (this.celsius)
      return false
  }
  }

```
```
let outsideTempt = new Celsius(10.0)
outsideTempt.celsius //returns 10.0
outsideTempt.getKelvinTemp() //returns 283.0
outsideTempt.getFahrenheitTemp() //returns 50.0
```

c. Give `Celsius` a method called `isBelowFreezing` that returns a `Bool` (true if the temperature is below freezing).

## Question 5

a. Create a class called `Movie` that has properties for `name`, `year`, `genre`, `cast`, and `description`. Create an instance of your `Movie`
```
class Movie{
  constructor(name, year, genre, cast, description){
    this.name = name;
    this.year = year;
    this.genre = genre;
    this.cast = cast;
    this.description = description
  }
  blurb(){
    return (`${this.name} came out in ${this.year}. It is a ${this.genre} film starring ${this.cast}. The description of the movie : ${this.description}`)
  }
}

let movie1 = new Movie('Soylent green', 1973, 'thriller',['Charlton Heston','Leigh Taylor-Young','Edward G. Robinson']), 'dystopian thriller film')

let movie2 = new Movie('Training Day', 2001, 'thriller',['	
Denzel Washington','Ethan Hawke','Cop thiller'])

```
b. Create an method inside `Movie` called `blurb` that returns a formatted string describing the movie.

Ex: "Borat came out in 2006. It was an odd film starring Sacha Baron Cohen as a man named Borat who was visiting America from Kazakhstan."


## Question 6

Write a class Vector that represents a vector in two-dimensional space.
It takes two number arguments: `x` and `y` parameters, which it should be saved to properties of the same name.

```

class vector {
  constructor(x, y) {
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
  }
  plus()

```


Give the Vector prototype two methods, `plus` and `minus`, that take another vector as an argument and
returns a new vector that has the sum or difference of the two vectorsâ€™ (the one in `this` and the parameter) x and y values.

Add a method `getLength` to the prototype that computes the length of the vector ;
that is, the distance of the point (x, y) from the origin (0, 0).(a^2 + b^2 = c^2)

[Vectors at mathisfun.com](https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/vectors.html)

```js
var v1 = new Vector(1, 2)
var v2 = new Vector(2, 3)
console.log(v1.plus(v2));
// => Vector {x: 3, y: 5}
console.log(v1.minus(v2));
// => Vector {x: -1, y: -1}

var v3 = new Vector(3, 4)
console.log(v3.getLength());
// => 5
```
## Question 7

a. Write a class called `Cylinder` that has properties `radius` and `height`.  Create an instance of a Cylinder.

b. Add an instance method `getVolume` that returns the [volume](https://www.mathopenref.com/cylindervolume.html)

c. Add an instance method `getSurfaceArea` that returns the [surface area](https://www.mathopenref.com/cylinderareamain.html)

## Question 8

[Dates in JavaScript](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-date-and-time-in-javascript#targetText=The%20Date%20object%20is%20a,the%20current%20date%20and%20time.)

a. Write a class called `Post` that has properties `datePosted`, `user`, and `text`.  Create an array of `Post` objects.

b. Create an instance method that returns whether or not the post was made today.

c. Filter your array of `Post` objects to only include posts made today.

## Question 9

a. Make a class called `Car` with properties `make` and `model`.  Create an instance of a `Car`

b. Make a class called `Bike` with properties `gears` and `hasBell`.  Create an instance of `Bike`

c. Give each class a static method called `numberOfWheels` that returns the number of wheels (2 for bikes, 4 for cars).  Why does it make sense for this to be a static method instead of an instance method?

## Question 10

a. Make a class called `Vehicle` with properties `color` and `name`.  Give it a method called `makeSound` which logs "WHHOOSSSH" to the console

b. Modify your `Car` and `Bike` classes from Question 7 to extend the `Vehicle` class.

c. Create a new `Bike` instance that has a `color` of "green" and `name` "Bikey McBikeface"

d. Create a new `Car` instance that has a `color` of "red" and `name` "Carry McCarface"
